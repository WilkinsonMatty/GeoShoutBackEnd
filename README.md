## GeoShout Back End

This is the back end of the GeoShout demo app. 

GeoShout is a basic full stack demo app that uses a variety of technologies. The app displays a map and allows the user to click anywhere to create a "shout" at that location (a simple message). At the same time, the app displays the nearest shouts on the map from the user and any other users of the app -- in other words, everyone sees each others' shouts. The shouts are transient and expire after a minute or two.

### What's Being In The Back:

 - Node.js and Express - The foundation of the API. 
 - MongoDB and Mongoose - for temporary storage
 - Docker/Docker Compose - the app is Dockerized and deployed as such
 - Digital Ocean - the app is hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS
